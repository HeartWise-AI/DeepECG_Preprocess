import shap
# Assume `model` is your 1D CNN model and `input_data` is your dataset shaped (samples, 2500, 12)

# Select a subset of your data as a background dataset for initializing the explainer
# This subset should be representative of the typical input space of your model
background_data = input_data[:100]  # For example, taking the first 100 samples

# Create a Deep SHAP explainer
# Note: Depending on the size of `background_data`, you might need to adjust for memory usage
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, background_data)

# Calculate SHAP values for a specific sample or set of samples
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(input_data[0:1])  # Example for the first sample

# Visualization of SHAP values
# SHAP offers various visualization tools; the choice depends on what you're trying to show
# For instance, you can use shap.force_plot for individual predictions
# or shap.summary_plot for a summary across features
shap.initjs()  # Necessary for Jupyter notebook visualization
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0], input_data[0])
